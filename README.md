# 🧓 ElderEase — Empowering Seniors with AI
ElderEase is an AI-powered companion built to simplify and support the lives of elderly individuals by addressing their daily healthcare, administrative, and emotional needs.


## ✨ Features
🔍 Personalized Government Schemes Finder (powered by Gemini API)
ElderEase uses Google’s Gemini API to analyze user queries and personal context (like location, age, and income bracket) to recommend relevant government welfare schemes. It ensures elderly users never miss out on benefits they're entitled to.

🏥 Health Insurance Claim Assistant
Navigating insurance claims can be confusing. ElderEase provides a guided experience using AI to help users understand their policy, maximize claim amounts, and generate ready-to-submit documentation for faster reimbursements.

💊 Smart Medication Reminders
Users can simply upload their medical prescriptions, and ElderEase intelligently sets up medication reminders with dosage and timing. The system also explains key instructions like "take after food" or potential side effects in easy-to-understand terms.

📓 AI-Powered Daily Journal
Mental wellness matters. ElderEase includes a daily journaling assistant that engages in short reflective conversations with users, tracks their mood, and encourages positive mental health practices through tailored prompts and affirmations.
